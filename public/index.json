This was subsequently hyped by various media outlets, sparking a series of discussions within and outside the condensed matter physics community regarding the use of the term “graviton” in the paper and the naming conventions for various quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07201-w This article does not intend to join the debate, as science itself is innocent, and it is often the execution by others that goes awry. Therefore, we might as well take this opportunity to understand the relevant theoretical and experimental knowledge and enjoy the scientific spectacle. For prerequisite content such as the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, you can refer to the notes I wrote a few years ago: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/574597173 Regarding Quantum Geometry, the Quantum Geometry mentioned here refers to a new intrinsic degree of freedom proposed by Haldane for the FQH ground state wave function under an anisotropic mass tensor or Coulomb interaction (Dielectric tensor). This is not entirely the same as the Quantum Geometry defined in a specific parameter space (such as momentum space) of the wave function that I have written about previously. However, both types of Quantum Geometry reveal a new property of quantum states in addition to the various topological properties that have emerged in recent decades—the importance of geometric properties and their responses. Regarding the latter, its manifestation in the fractional quantum Hall effect and its nonlinear optical and transport responses are hot topics in the field of condensed matter physics recently. Those interested can refer to my previous notes or follow my future updates: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/580756343 https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/586913698 https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/580954377 https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/581596244 https://www.zhihu.com/question/616351382/answer/3157331169 Returning to the Quantum Geometry proposed by Haldane as a new intrinsic degree of freedom of the FQH wave function, later researchers found that this Quantum Geometry not only describes a parameter of the FQH ground state wave function but can also be regarded as a dynamic parameter. It corresponds to the dynamics of the most important collective neutral excitation in FQH—the magnetoroton excitation—in the long-wavelength limit. Since this long-wavelength magnetoroton excitation is extremely difficult to observe and originates from intrinsic Quantum Geometry Dynamics, condensed matter theorists have also termed this excitation mode “graviton” (some literature still refers to it as the magnetoroton in the long-wavelength limit, but that isn’t catchy enough to get funding, just kidding). This is obviously an analogy with the gravitational waves caused by the curvature of the spacetime metric in general relativity. At the same time, due to the spin-2 characteristic of this excitation, it is also analogous to the spin-2 graviton that we hope to quantize in quantum field theory. This can be said to be brushing against High Energy physics, or it can be said to be an extension and enrichment of the concept of the graviton in condensed matter systems. After all, concepts from high energy physics such as Weyl Fermions and Majorana Fermions have also been introduced into the field of condensed matter physics, which is often commonplace for insiders. Furthermore, this graviton also possesses chirality. For example, in an FQH state with filling $\\nu = 1/3$, its Graviton excitation not only has spin 2 but also has an angular momentum of $-2$. Conversely, in its particle-hole conjugate FQH state with filling $\\nu = 1 - 1/3$, the spin angular momentum of the Graviton excitation becomes $2$.

This non-commutative algebra can give different LLL (Lowest Landau Level) single-particle wavefunctions under various gauge selections. For example, under the isotropic condition $g^{ab} = \\delta^{ab}$ and symmetric gauge, the rotational symmetry of the system can be preserved, so the LLL single-particle wavefunction can be a common eigenstate of $H_0$ and the angular momentum $L_z$. The LLL single-particle wavefunction constructed in this way and the Laughlin many-body wavefunction constructed on this basis are both rotationally symmetric. But Haldane considered a more general anisotropic Galilean metric, where $g^{ab}$ is not isotropic. At the same time, Haldane further considered the interaction anisotropy characterized by the interaction metric $\\tilde g^{ab}$: $$ \\lim_{\\lambda \\rightarrow 0} \\lambda V(\\lambda \\bm q) \\rightarrow \\frac{e^2}{2\\varepsilon}(\\tilde g^{ab}q_aq_b)^{-1/2} , $$ These two types of anisotropy come from the anisotropy of the band mass tensor and the dielectric tensor, respectively, and can be two independent metrics. previously, the FQH systems we considered often assumed both metrics to be isotropic by default, so the obtained wavefunctions were also isotropic. This fails to reflect the anisotropy that may appear in the wavefunction itself and its intrinsic quantum geometry information. Now, to discuss the anisotropy of the band mass tensor and dielectric tensor, we need to construct anisotropic LLL wavefunctions similar to the isotropic case. In this process, we will discover the intrinsic quantum geometric degrees of freedom of the system itself.

Details can be found in: https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.85.115308 Specifically, at this time we only need to consider the anisotropy of the mass tensor. We can use a unimodular complex vector $\\omega$ to parametrize the mass tensor: $$ m_{ab}=m (\\omega_a^*\\omega_b + \\omega_b^*\\omega_a) $$ $$ (m^{-1})^{ab}=m^{-1}(\\omega^{a*}\\omega^b + \\omega^{b*}\\omega^a). $$ It is not difficult to find that the special case of isotropic is $\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (1, i)^T$, and a more general $\\omega$ represents the general anisotropic case, which relates to our discussion of the connection between the two and the analogy and generalization from the former to the latter. Construction of Landau Level and Guiding Center Ladder Operators The single-particle Hamiltonian can be expressed as: $$ H_0 ={\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}}\\hbar \\omega_c \\left( b^{\\dagger}b + bb^{\\dagger}\\right) $$ where $\\hbar\\omega_c = \\hbar^2/m\\ell^2$ is the cyclotron energy. The Landau Level ladder operators under anisotropic conditions can be generalized to: $$ b = \\hbar^{-1}\\ell \\left (\\bm \\omega \\cdot \\bm \\pi\\right ), \\quad b^\\dagger = \\hbar^{-1}\\ell \\left (\\bm \\omega^* \\cdot \\bm \\pi\\right ) $$ The ladder operators satisfy the commutation relation $[b,b^{\\dagger}] = 1$. This ladder operator is used to raise and lower the wavefunction between different Landau Levels, with a difference of one cyclotron energy before and after. Further introduce “guiding center” coordinates $\\bm R$: $$ R^a=r^a+\\hbar^{-1}\\ell^2\\epsilon^{ab}\\pi_b, $$ The “guiding center” coordinate operators satisfy: $$ [R^a, R^b]=-i\\epsilon^{ab}\\ell^2,\\quad [R^a,\\pi_b]=0, $$ The “guiding center” coordinates $\\bm R$ are used to generate “guiding center” ladder operators: $a$, $a^{\\dagger}$: $$ a=\\ell^{-1}\\left({\\bm \\omega}^*\\cdot{\\bm R}\\right), \\quad a^\\dagger=\\ell^{-1}\\left({\\bm \\omega}\\cdot{\\bm R}\\right), \\quad [a,a^\\dagger]=1 $$ This set of creation and annihilation operators commutes with the Landau Level ladder operators $b$ and $b^{\\dagger}$, and can thus describe the degeneracy of the LLL single-particle wavefunction within the same Landau Level. This is also a classic operation in isotropic LL derivation. It is worth noting that the above discussion can obtain information such as Landau Level and its degeneracy without introducing a specific gauge. In other words, the construction of the LLL wavefunction does not require introducing a symmetric gauge to preserve rotational symmetry. This shows that the isotropic nature of QH and FQH states that we assumed by default in the past is itself accidental. We are completely free to choose anisotropic LLL wavefunctions to construct the degrees of freedom of FQH theory, which was ignored before. For more detailed derivation, please refer to UCSD’s QHE related notes: https://courses.physics.ucsd.edu/2019/Spring/physics230/LECTURES/QHE.pdf Introduction of Symmetric Gauge Furthermore, we will show that we can construct anisotropic LLL wavefunctions even under the symmetric gauge. This is because LLL wavefunctions are often determined by the common eigenstates of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ and angular momentum $L_z$. We will show that we can obtain different LLL single-particle wavefunctions as the basis for discussing FQH by constructing an anisotropic $L_z$. We now choose the symmetric gauge: $$ {\\bm A}={\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}{\\bm B}\\times{\\bm r}={\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}B(-y,x), $$ And use $\\omega$ containing mass tensor anisotropy information to construct the complex coordinate: $$ z = \\frac{\\bm \\omega \\cdot \\bm r}{\\ell}. $$ In the special case of an isotropic mass tensor, we have, $$z = \\frac{x+iy}{\\sqrt{2}\\ell}$$ We can skillfully construct the representation of the Landau Level and guiding center ladder operators under complex coordinates.

No. We can also modify the definition of $L_0$ (that is, modify the degrees of freedom of the Guiding center Metric) to show that before introducing interaction and Coulomb metric, our wavefunction selection still has an intrinsic quantum geometry degree of freedom to choose from. Our Guiding Center $R$, and its ladder operators $a,\\,a^\\dagger$, were constructed to specify the degenerate state within a unified LL. However, as we learned when first studying quantum mechanics, the selection of a complete basis for degenerate states is not unique. We can completely perform a unitary transformation on this set of bases to obtain a new set of complete bases. In the context of our discussion on the Guiding Center, recall our previous construction of the Guiding Center Ladder Operator: $$ R^a=r^a+\\hbar^{-1}\\ell^2\\epsilon^{ab}\\pi_b, $$ The “guiding center” coordinate operators satisfy: $$ [R^a, R^b]=-i\\epsilon^{ab}\\ell^2,\\quad [R^a,\\pi_b]=0, $$ Construction of “guiding center” ladder operators: $a$, $a^{\\dagger}$: $$ a=\\ell^{-1}\\left({\\bm \\omega}^*\\cdot{\\bm R}\\right), \\quad a^\\dagger=\\ell^{-1}\\left({\\bm \\omega}\\cdot{\\bm R}\\right), \\quad [a,a^\\dagger]=1 $$ It is not difficult to find that we presumptuously used the unimodular vector $\\omega$ defined by the Galilean Metric to define the ladder operator of the Guiding center. But we said: we can completely perform a unitary transformation on this set of bases to obtain a new set of complete bases. This is completely fine in the non-interacting case. Our system currently has no reason to specify the Galilean metric as its intrinsic property. Conversely, this uncertainty in the selection of the complete basis gives us a new degree of freedom for constructing the LLL single-particle wavefunction, namely the degree of freedom of the Guiding Center Metric. This will later evolve into the Intrinsic Quantum Geometric degree of freedom that we often discuss in FQH (metric and geometry are often inseparable). In the article “Model Anisotropic quantum Hall states” by RZ Qiu, FDM Haldane, X Wan, K Yang, S Yi et al., it is explained as follows: We first split the angular momentum operator: $$ L_0 = L + \\bar L $$ $$ L = {\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}(b^{\\dagger}b + bb^{\\dagger}) $$ $$ H_0 = \\hbar \\omega_c L $$ $$ \\bar L = {\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}(a^{\\dagger}a + aa^{\\dagger}). $$ It is not difficult to find that $L$ in $L_0 = L + \\bar L$ already commutes with $H_0$, so the nontrivial part of $L_0$ comes from $\\bar L$. Then the common eigenstates of $H_0$ and $\\bar L$ that we originally defined can determine the m-th degenerate wavefunction of the n-th LL $$ \\bar L |\\psi_{nm} \\rangle = (m+{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}})|\\psi_{nm}\\rangle $$ To reflect how the Galilean metric “presumptuously” entered our construction of the Guiding center Degeneracy degree of freedom in the above discussion, we can write $\\bar L$ as: $$ \\bar L = \\bar L(g^0) $$ And define $\\bar L$ under an arbitrary guiding center metric: $$ \\bar L(g) = \\frac{1}{2\\ell^2}g_{ab}R^aR^b $$ Here we denote the “Galilean metric” from the band mass tensor as $g^0_{ab}$ to reflect its distinctiveness. At the same time, we also use a unimodular vector $\\bar \\omega$ to define an arbitrary guiding center metric. For $\\bar L$ under an arbitrary guiding center metric: $$ m_{ab}=m(\\omega^*_a\\omega_b+\\omega^*_b\\omega_a)=mg^0_{ab}. $$ Similarly, $\\bar \\omega$ can be used to parametrize any guiding center metric: $$ g_{ab} = \\bar \\omega^*_a \\bar \\omega_b+ \\bar \\omega^*_b \\bar \\omega_a. $$ This is equivalent to choosing the following when constructing the “guiding center” ladder operators: $a$, $a^{\\dagger}$: $$ a=\\ell^{-1}\\left(\\bar {\\bm \\omega}^*\\cdot{\\bm R}\\right), \\quad a^\\dagger=\\ell^{-1}\\left( \\bar {\\bm \\omega}\\cdot{\\bm R}\\right), \\quad [a,a^\\dagger]=1 $$ From $\\omega$ to an arbitrary $\\bar \\omeg","date":"2024-04-05","objectID":"/OkongOyangO.Notes/posts/chiral-graviton-in-fqhe/:2:3","tags":["FQHE","Graviton","Metric","Quantum Geometry"],"title":"🤯Chiral Graviton in Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE)","uri":"/OkongOyangO.Notes/posts/chiral-graviton-in-fqhe/"},{"categories":["Physics Notes"],"content":"Compromise of Intrinsic Geometry between Galilean and Coulomb Metric As mentioned before, after we introduce interaction, the Hamiltonian is: $$ H=T+V, $$ The kinetic energy contains the Galilean metric, which is one of the sources of the anisotropy QH/FQH state, generally written as: $$ T=\\frac{1}{2}(m^{-1})^{\\mu\\nu}\\Pi_{\\mu}\\Pi_{\\nu} = \\frac{g^{\\mu\\nu}\\Pi_{\\mu}\\Pi_{\\nu}}{2m}, $$ For simplicity, by redefining basis, we can also write it as; $$ T=\\sum_j{1\\over 2m}\\left[a(\\Pi^j_x)^2+(\\Pi^j_y)^2/a\\right]. $$ In this way, $a=1$ degenerates to the isotropic case, and a general $a$ represents the selection of a general anisotropic Galilean metric.

For simplicity, we can only consider the case of anisotropic band mass tensor + isotropic Coulomb interaction, because our main purpose is to see how the guiding center metric selects the ground state with lower energy after adding interaction, so that the arbitrary guiding center metric selection in the noninteracting problem becomes an intrinsic property of the FQH many-body state in the interacting problem. Projected Interaction To simplify the model, we consider the case where the magnetic field is very large, and the splitting $\\hbar \\omega_c$ between LLs is much larger than the interaction scale $e^2/a$, so that we can assume that the wavefunction basically does not enter the higher landau level, and thus the entire problem can be projected to the LLL for discussion. This is also a customary operation when discussing fractional Chern insulators.

In the model, the degree of freedom that is easier to couple directly is the band mass tensor, for example, using acoustic waves to perturb the FQH background lattice system. We tentatively assume that our picture of Intrinsic Quantum Geometry determined by band mass tensor anisotropy under Gaussian Interaction discussed above is also feasible in more general cases. Then we can consider that coupling the band mass tensor is equivalent to indirectly coupling the Intrinsic Quantum Geometry. For simplicity, still use the kinetic energy: $$ T=\\sum_j{1\\over 2m}\\left[a(\\Pi^j_x)^2+(\\Pi^j_y)^2/a\\right]. $$ This is equivalent to selecting the Galilean metric: $$ g_{ab} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 a^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} $$ Consider the general LLL projected interaction again: $$ \\tilde{V}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\bf q}V_{\\bf q}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(aq_x^2+q_y^2/a)\\ell^2}\\overline{\\rho}_{\\bf q}\\overline{\\rho}_{-{\\bf q}}, $$ $$ \\overline{\\rho}_{\\bf q}=\\sum_{i}e^{i{\\bf q}\\cdot{\\bf R}_i} $$ Assume we perform a time-dependent perturbation on the band mass anisotropy through acoustic wave: $$ a=1+\\xi(t) $$ This will be reflected in the oscillating metric through $g = g(a)$. We know that the physical image of the oscillating metric is the gravitational wave. Then the quasiparticles excited by the oscillating metric are very likely to have similar properties to the graviton discussed in high energy physics. Expand $\\tilde{V}$ according to $a=1+\\xi(t)$: $$ \\delta\\tilde{V}(t)=\\frac{\\xi(t)}{4}\\sum_{\\bf q}(q^2_y - q^2_x)V_{\\bf q}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}q^2\\ell^2}\\overline{\\rho}_{\\bf q}\\overline{\\rho}_{-{\\bf q}}. $$ We find that the part of $(q^2_y - q^2_x)$ indeed has d-wave symmetry. This shows that the quasiparticles excited by the oscillating metric are likely to be quasiparticles with spin 2. This “coincides” with the spin-2 nature of the graviton widely believed in high energy physics (essentially because both are oscillations of the metric field, it is not difficult to guess that their quantum have similar properties). For harmonic perturbation, the experimentally measured spectral function is not difficult to obtain through the well-known Fermi Golden Rule: $$ I(\\omega)=\\sum_n|\\langle n|\\hat{O}|0\\rangle|^2\\delta(\\omega-\\omega_n), $$ Where the perturbation operator is: $$ \\hat{O}=\\sum_{\\bf q}(q^2_y - q^2_x)V_{\\bf q}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}q^2\\ell^2}\\overline{\\rho}_{\\bf q}\\overline{\\rho}_{-{\\bf q}} $$ We can further split this perturbation operator into the form of $S_z = \\pm 2$: $$ \\hat{O}_\\mp^{(2)}=\\sum_{\\bf q}(q_x \\mp i q_y)^2 V_{\\bf q}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}q^2\\ell^2}\\overline{\\rho}_{\\bf q}\\overline{\\rho}_{-{\\bf q}}, $$ These two operators reflect the graviton excitation with spin $S_z = \\pm2$ respectively.

We will explain the source of this choice later. Conversely, for the particle-hole conjugate FQH state, the spin of the graviton excitation is opposite, which further reflects its Chiral nature.

This idea of Geometric Description of FQH state has also been introduced into systems discussing Band Geometry such as fractional Chern insulators, providing insights into the stability and other properties of FQH states in lattice systems. For example, a PRL titled “Position-momentum duality and fractional quantum hall effect in chern insulators” by Claassen, M., Lee, C. H., Thomale, R., Qi, X. L., \u0026 Devereaux, T. P. et al. in 2015 discussed the connection between Band Geometry and the Intrinsic Quantum Geometry of the FQH state. Specifically, in the Band System, we have the symplectic geometry of the wave function space (Projected Hilbert Space $\\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$), the imaginary part of which is the Berry Curvature we are familiar with, similar to the magnetic field in momentum space: $$ \\Omega(k) = \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu} \\partial_{k_\\mu} \\mathbf{A}_\\nu(k) $$ Coming from a vector potential similar to momentum space, Berry Connection: $$ \\mathbf{A}_\\nu(k) = -i \\langle u_k | \\partial_{k_\\nu} | u_k \\rangle $$ The real part of the symplectic geometry defines the metric of the wave function space, namely the Fubini-Study metric $$ g_{\\mu\\nu}(k) = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\partial_{k_\\mu} u_k | \\left[1 - |u_k\\rangle \\langle u_k | \\right] | \\partial_{k_\\nu} u_k \\rangle + \\left(\\mu \\leftrightarrow \\nu \\right) $$ Using a method similar to distinguishing degeneracy in LLL through angular momentum operators in FQH, we can similarly define a confinement potential to coincide with the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, thereby achieving the purpose of defining “pseudo-angular momentum operators” in lattice systems that break rotational symmetry: $$ \\hat{V}(r)= \\tfrac{1}{2} \\lambda~ x_{\\mu} \\eta^{\\mu\\nu} x_{\\nu} $$ $\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}$ can be used to describe the metric used to define the “pseudo-angular momentum operator” in the lattice system that breaks rotational symmetry, that is, the analogy of Guiding Center Metric in Lattice System, which is the Lattice version of Intrinsic Quantum Geometry. Considering the projection on LLL similarly, the projection of this single-particle “pseudo-angular momentum operator” (essentially an artificial confinement potential) is: $$ \\bar{V} = \\hat P\\hat V(r)\\hat P^\\top= \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\Pi_\\mu \\eta^{\\mu\\nu} \\Pi_\\nu + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\eta^{\\mu\\nu} g_{\\nu\\mu},\\,k \\in {\\rm BZ} $$ The first term on the right is the common kinetic energy operator we see. In addition, there is a term coupled with Band Geometry. This shows that the FQH physics in the Lattice System is also affected by Band Geometry compared to the FQH physics in the continuum system. The coupling between the two gives the physics of Intrinsic Quantum Geometry of FQH in a more general system.

","uri":"/OkongOyangO.Notes/posts/distinguish_conductors_insulators_ground_state/"},{"categories":["Physics Notes"],"content":"Introduction “Distinguishing conductors and insulators by only looking at the ground state”—this argument seems a bit outrageous. The Band Theory of the 1930s (to some extent) explained the difference between conductors and insulators. At the non-interacting level, conductors and insulators can be distinguished by whether the ground state energy bands are filled. If the valence band is filled and there is a band gap $E_g \u003e 0$ separating it from the conduction band, it is an insulator; otherwise, it is a conductor. Here, the band gap $E_g$ is used to distinguish them, but defining $E_g$ requires knowing the energy of excited states, thus inevitably involving excited state properties. However, the Mott Insulator (caused by strong electron-electron correlation) proposed in 1949 and the Anderson Insulator (caused by strong disorder) proposed in 1958 pointed out the loopholes of Band Theory in distinguishing conductors and insulators. That is, the insulating mechanism of many-body systems involves not only filled valence bands but also strong correlations and disorder. Similarly, besides the absence of a band gap being a mechanism for conductivity, some disordered metal alloys can be conductors. Conversely, in disordered alloy systems, even without a band gap, they might still be insulators, which is exactly the Anderson Localization where localized states cannot stably transport current. Moreover, a many-body system might not have a lattice at all. We urgently need a more universal indicator to judge the conductive properties of many-body systems. Phenomenologically, the difference between a conductor and an insulator lies in the difference in DC conductivity $\\operatorname{Re}\\sigma(\\omega\\rightarrow 0)$, because general insulators can also conduct electricity under AC current. Or they can be distinguished by electric polarization: in insulators, electrons are bound and can only move near atoms, resulting in obvious electric polarization phenomena; while in conductors, electrons tend to move freely, and an external electric field will cause them to flow freely, so there is no well-defined electric polarization. We can always calculate conductivity or polarizability through Linear Response Theory to distinguish conductors and insulators, but this still requires considering the properties of excited states. However, Kohn proposed in his 1964 paper “Theory of the insulating state” that the conductivity of a many-body system can be judged by the “locality” of the ground state many-body wavefunction in the many-body configuration space. https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.133.A171 In the late 20th century, Resta and others noticed that this degree of locality could be better characterized by the second cumulant moment $\\langle r_\\alpha r_\\beta \\rangle_c$ (“c” for “cumulant”) of the many-body ground state wavefunction, and revealed its essence of Quantum Geometry. https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.370 So first, let’s clarify how to define the degree of locality of a wavefunction.

Moreover, deriving it from the perspective of single-particle wavefunctions is simpler, so we will first introduce the definition of locality for single-particle wavefunctions, discuss its properties, and then generalize it to the many-body case in the papers of Kohn, Resta, et al. Taking a solid-state band system as an example, whether it is an insulator or a conductor, its single-electron eigenstates are extended Bloch wavefunctions. However, we can transform these spatially extended Bloch eigenstates into spatially localized Wannier Functions via Fourier Transform. The transformation relationship between the Wannier function $|\\mathbf{R} n\\rangle$ and the Bloch wavefunction $\\left|\\psi_{n \\mathbf{k}}\\right\\rangle$: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\left|\\psi_{n \\mathbf{k}}\\right\\rangle=\\sum_{\\mathbf{R}} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}}|\\mathbf{R} n\\rangle \\Leftrightarrow |\\mathbf{R} n\\rangle=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} e^{-i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}}\\left|\\psi_{n \\mathbf{k}}\\right\\rangle \\end{aligned} $$The degree of locality of the Wannier wavefunction is related to the gauge selection of the energy band.

To find a parameter space where Quantum Geometry can be constructed, we perform a gauge transformation on the many-body Hamiltonian: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}) \\equiv e^{-i \\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}} \\hat{H} e^{i \\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}} \\end{aligned} $$Where $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\equiv \\sum_i \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_i$.

The most important thing for a many-body system is the ground state.

We notice: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}) \\equiv e^{-i \\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}} \\hat{H} e^{i \\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}} \\end{aligned} $$Assuming $\\left|\\Psi_0\\right\\rangle$ is the non-degenerate ground state of $\\hat{H}$, we can easily write the ground state of $\\hat{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})$ (assuming open boundary conditions for now; periodic boundary conditions are more complex): $$ \\begin{aligned} \\left|\\Psi_0(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa})\\right\\rangle=e^{-i \\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot(\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}-\\mathbf{d})}\\left|\\Psi_0\\right\\rangle \\end{aligned} $$Where $\\mathbf{d}=\\left\\langle\\Psi_0|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}| \\Psi_0\\right\\rangle$.

However, this quantity is an extensive quantity (like volume), and will scale with $N$ in the thermodynamic limit $N\\rightarrow\\infty$. In order to compare this “locality” between different systems, we average it for each electron to make it a comparable intensive quantity (like pressure). Of course, this can also be achieved by changing the normalization definition of the wavefunction: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\left\\langle r_\\alpha r_\\beta\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{c}} =\\eta_{\\alpha \\beta}(0) / N \\end{aligned} $$It is not difficult to find that, unlike the degree of localization of the single-particle Wannier wavefunction which requires integration over all momenta $k$, $\\Omega_I \\propto \\int_{BZ}d^dk \\operatorname{tr}g(k)$, here we only need the information of the parameter space $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} = 0$, that is, the ground state information of the original system. $$ \\begin{aligned} \\left\\langle r_\\alpha r_\\beta\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{c}}= \\frac{1}{N} \\left(\\left\\langle\\Psi_0\\left|\\hat{r}_\\alpha \\hat{r}_\\beta\\right| \\Psi_0\\right\\rangle-\\left\\langle\\Psi_0\\left|\\hat{r}_\\alpha\\right| \\Psi_0\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\Psi_0\\left|\\hat{r}_\\beta\\right| \\Psi_0\\right\\rangle \\right) \\end{aligned} $$For convenience of derivation later (to better compare with the conductivity formula), it can also be written in the form of “sum of states”: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\left\\langle r_\\alpha r_\\beta\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{c}}= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n \\neq 0}^{\\prime} \\frac{\\left\\langle\\Psi_0\\left|\\partial_\\alpha \\hat{H}(0)\\right| \\Psi_n\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\Psi_n\\left|\\partial_\\beta \\hat{H}(0)\\right| \\Psi_0\\right\\rangle}{\\left(E_0-E_n\\right)^2} \\end{aligned} $$Where, $$ \\begin{aligned} \\nabla_\\kappa \\hat{H}(0) =\\frac{\\hbar}{m_e} \\sum_{i=1}^N\\left[\\mathbf{p}_i+\\frac{e}{c} \\mathbf{A}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_i\\right)\\right] = \\hbar \\hat{\\mathbf{v}} \\end{aligned} $$This is effectively the momentum (velocity) operator, so it can be further rewritten as: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\left\\langle r_\\alpha r_\\beta\\right\\rangle_","date":"2023-05-14","objectID":"/OkongOyangO.Notes/posts/distinguish_conductors_insulators_ground_state/:4:0","tags":["Condensed Matter","Insulators"],"title":"🤔How to Distinguish Conductors and Insulators by Ground State Only?

Finally, we can answer the question at the beginning of this article: How to distinguish conductors and insulators by only looking at the ground state? For systems with a band gap, since all excitation energies $\\hbar \\omega_{0n} \\geq E_g$, from the linear response formula of conductivity $\\operatorname{Re} \\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta}^{(+)}(\\omega) \\simeq \\sum \\delta\\left(\\omega-\\omega_{0 n}\\right)$, it is obvious that the conductivity is 0 when $\\omega \\rightarrow 0$, so it is an insulator. Thus, the lower limit of the integral for $\\operatorname{Re} \\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta}^{(+)}(\\omega) \\simeq \\sum \\delta\\left(\\omega-\\omega_{0 n}\\right)$ can be changed to $E_g/\\hbar \u003e 0$: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Re}\\left\\langle r_\\alpha r_\\alpha\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{c}} =\\frac{\\hbar L^3}{\\pi e^2 N} \\int_{E_{\\mathrm{g} /} \\hbar}^{\\infty} \\frac{d \\omega}{\\omega} \\operatorname{Re} \\sigma_{\\alpha \\alpha}(\\omega) \\end{aligned} $$ $$ \\begin{aligned} \u003c\\frac{\\hbar L^3}{\\pi e^2 N} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{d \\omega}{E_{\\mathrm{g}}/\\hbar} \\operatorname{Re} \\sigma_{\\alpha \\alpha}(\\omega) =\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m_e E_{\\mathrm{g}}} \\end{aligned} $$This shows that $\\operatorname{Re}\\left\\langle r_\\alpha r_\\alpha\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{c}}$ has an upper bound and is finite, which corresponds to the localized many-body ground state we defined earlier. In this way, we can determine whether the system is an insulator or a conductor entirely by the locality of the many-body ground state: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Many-body ground state \"Localized\"} \\Leftrightarrow \\text{System is Insulator}(E_g\u003e0) \\end{aligned} $$Conversely, for a conductor (metal) with static longitudinal conductivity $\\lim_{\\omega \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Re} \\sigma_{\\alpha \\alpha}(\\omega) \u003e 0$, we find that the above integral at $\\omega \\rightarrow 0$: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Re}\\left\\langle r_\\alpha r_\\alpha\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{c}} \\simeq \\frac{\\hbar L^3 }{\\pi e^2 N} \\lim_{\\omega \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Re} \\sigma_{\\alpha \\alpha}(\\omega)\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{d \\omega}{\\omega} \\end{aligned} $$Obviously diverges at $\\omega \\rightarrow 0$, so $\\operatorname{Re}\\left\\langle r_\\alpha r_\\alpha\\right\\rangle_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\infty$. Thus we have: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Many-body ground state \"Delocalized\"} \\Leftrightarrow \\text{System is Conductor} \\end{aligned} $$Of course, there is a special case, the gapless case $E_g = 0$. At this time, whether the many-body ground state is “localized” or not still depends on the behavior of the static longitudinal conductivity $\\lim_{\\omega \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Re} \\sigma_{\\alpha \\alpha}(\\omega)$. For example, if $\\lim_{\\omega \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Re} \\sigma_{\\alpha \\alpha}(\\omega) \\propto \\omega^{\\alpha \\geq 1}$, then the many-body ground state is still localized and is an insulator; conversely, if $\\lim_{\\omega \\rightarrow 0} \\operatorname{Re} \\sigma_{\\alpha \\alpha}(\\omega) \\propto \\omega^{\\alpha \u003c 1}$, then the many-body ground state is delocalized and is a conductor. Among them, the strongly disordered Anderson Insulator belongs to the former, because although outside the mobility edge of the disordered system is the energy spectrum (which can make the system gapless), the electronic states outside the mobility edge undergo Anderson Localization and do not contribute to conductivity, so it is still an insulator overall; while band metals or weakly disordered, weakly correlated conductor systems belong to the latter. In this way, for any many-body system (regardless of symmetry, disorder, strong correlation, etc.), we can distinguish all insulators and conductors just by looking at the electron locality of the many-body ground state wavefunction.

These Wannier wave functions are not eigenstates of the system; they are merely a linear combination of Bloch wave functions that are localized in real space, and they depend on the gauge selection of the energy bands.

In fact, this was not fully resolved for decades after the proposal of band theory. Relevant content can be found in Vanderbilt’s 1997 PRB paper, “Maximally localized generalized Wannier functions for composite energy bands”: https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.56.12847 And the 2012 RMP paper, “Maximally localized Wannier functions: Theory and applications”: https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.84.1419 It is worth mentioning that numerically finding the Maximally Localized Wannier Function is very important for improving the efficiency of first-principles calculations. Relevant theories have important applications in programs like wannier90. Let’s briefly introduce Vanderbilt’s theory. First, we need to define the degree of localization of the Wannier function. We might as well define it using the standard deviation of its real-space distribution, the so-called Spread Functional: $$ \\Omega=\\left[\\left\\langle\\mathbf{0} n\\left|r^2\\right| \\mathbf{0} n\\right\\rangle-\\langle\\mathbf{0} n|\\mathbf{r}| \\mathbf{0} n\\rangle^2\\right]=\\left[\\left\\langle r^2\\right\\rangle_n-\\overline{\\mathbf{r}}_n^2\\right] $$This Spread Functional depends on the gauge selection, but it can be divided into a gauge-invariant part $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{I}}$ and a gauge-dependent part $\\tilde{\\Omega}$: $$ \\Omega=\\Omega_{\\mathrm{I}}+\\tilde{\\Omega} $$Where, $$ \\Omega_{\\mathrm{I}}=\\left\\langle\\mathbf{0} n\\left|r^2\\right| \\mathbf{0} n\\right\\rangle-\\sum_{\\mathbf{R},m}|\\langle\\mathbf{R} m|\\mathbf{r}| \\mathbf{0} n\\rangle|^2 $$$$ \\tilde{\\Omega}=\\sum_{\\mathbf{R} m \\neq 0 n}|\\langle\\mathbf{R} m|\\mathbf{r}| \\mathbf{0} n\\rangle|^2 $$In fact, the gauge-dependent part $\\tilde{\\Omega}$ is a non-negative value, so we always have: $$ \\Omega \\geq \\Omega_{\\mathrm{I}} $$Naively, we hope to adjust the gauge so that $\\tilde{\\Omega}$ is as close to 0 as possible; the gauge-invariant part of the Spread Functional, $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{I}}$, gives the lower bound for the localization degree of the Wannier function. Why is $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{I}}$ gauge invariant? Let’s rewrite its form: $$ \\Omega_{\\mathrm{I}} =\\sum_{\\alpha}\\left\\langle 0 n\\left|r_\\alpha Q r_\\alpha\\right| 0 n\\right\\rangle=\\sum_\\alpha \\operatorname{Tr}\\left[P r_\\alpha Q r_\\alpha\\right] $$Where $P$ is the projection operator onto the considered energy band: $$ P =\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}\\left|\\psi_{n \\mathbf{k}}\\right\\rangle\\langle\\psi_{n \\mathbf{k}}|=\\sum_{\\mathbf{R}}| \\mathbf{R} n\\rangle\\langle\\mathbf{R} n| $$The ket and bra cancel the gauge exactly, so $P$ and $Q=1-P$ are obviously gauge invariant (the band projection operator does not depend on the specific gauge selection).

The first equality holds because $| 0 n\\rangle$ and $| R n\\rangle$ are also superpositions of eigenstates on band $n$, so naturally: $$ P| R n\\rangle = | R n\\rangle $$Corresponding conclusions can be generalized to higher dimensions. Taking 3D as an example, if we require $\\Omega = \\Omega_{\\mathrm{I}}$, then the Maximally Localized Wannier Function needs to be a simultaneous eigenstate of $P\\hat{x}P$, $P\\hat{y}P$, and $P\\hat{z}P$. However, this is generally impossible. As a complete basis for a certain band, if the Maximally Localized Wannier Function is to be a simultaneous eigenstate of $P\\hat{x}P$, $P\\hat{y}P$, and $P\\hat{z}P$, then these coordinate operators projected onto that band must commute pairwise. Before projection, this holds easily, but after projection, it is not necessarily true. In other words, if the projected coordinate operators $P\\hat{x}P$, $P\\hat{y}P$, $P\\hat{z}P$, etc., do not commute, the Spread Functional cannot be minimized to 0, nor can we have $\\Omega_{min} = \\Omega_{\\mathrm{I}}$. But we can always take the gauge invariant $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{I}}$ as the lower bound for the localization degree of the Wannier function. Since the Wannier function of a 1D system is easy to solve (finding the eigenstate of $P\\hat{x}P$), it is very effective to analyze the wave packet motion of electrons in one dimension. Even if it is not a 1D problem, we can always use the partial Wannier function, i.e., the Wannier function with Fourier Transform performed only in one direction: $$ |x,k_y, n\\rangle=\\frac{1}{N_x} \\sum_{k_x} e^{-i k_x x}\\left|\\psi_{n,k_x,k_y}\\right\\rangle $$At this time, in this direction alone, the spread range (Spread Functional) of the Maximally Localized (Partial) Wannier Function can reach the minimum value $\\Omega_{min} = \\Omega_{\\mathrm{I}}$, which can be used to analyze the electron polarization problem in one direction.

Let’s first examine the form of the Spread Functional describing the localization degree of the Wannier Function: $$ \\Omega \\sim \\langle r_\\mu r_\\nu \\rangle $$It is roughly the correlation function of the coordinate operator, and in the momentum representation, the coordinate operator can be expressed as a momentum derivative: $$ r_\\mu \\sim \\partial_{k_\\mu} $$Recall the definition of the Quantum Geometric Tensor, which exactly contains the second-order partial derivative of momentum: $$ Q_{\\mu\\nu} \\sim \\langle \\partial_{k_\\mu} \\partial_{k_\\nu} \\rangle $$So we can think about the connection between the two. Going a step further, we consider the issue of gauge invariance. The gauge invariance of the electromagnetic field is reflected in the fact that the choice of different gauges does not affect the field strength. Similarly, in topological band theory, we know that the gauge selection of the Bloch wave function does not affect the Berry Curvature (so we say Berry Curvature is like a “magnetic field” in momentum space). Berry Curvature is actually an antisymmetric component of Quantum Geometry; in fact, Quantum Geometry is also an intrinsic gauge-invariant property of the system. So, in order to more reasonably compare Quantum Geometry and the localization degree of the Wannier Function, we will compare the relationship between $Q_{\\mu\\nu}$ and the gauge-invariant part $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{I}}$ in the Spread Functional.

We then use this guessed solution to calculate various properties of the system’s ground state (zero temperature). Similarly, the variational principle can be applied to finite temperature systems, simply by changing “guessed ground state wave function” to “guessed equilibrium density matrix.” Here we perform the derivation using the canonical ensemble, and for convenience, we set the unit system $k_B = 1$.

This proves that the mean field approximation is indeed a variational method. In the mean field approximation, we replace the interaction part in the complete Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = \\hat{H}_0 + \\hat{V}_{int}$ with a quadratic operator containing parameters, i.e., $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{H}_{mf}(\\lambda) = \\hat{H}_0 + \\hat{V}_{mf}(\\lambda) \\end{aligned} $$Replacing the quartic interaction operator with a quadratic mean field operator will break some symmetries of the Hamiltonian, which is ultimately reflected in the symmetry breaking of the guessed wave function or guessed density operator.

Through the variational method and Wick’s theorem, we proved that the optimal undetermined coefficients $\\{\\lambda_i^{mf}\\}$ coincide exactly with the results of selecting first-order fluctuation terms in the decoupling method, meaning the optimal undetermined coefficients $\\{\\lambda_i^{mf}\\}$ are the system’s mean field (order parameters). Returning to the original question “Can Hartree, Fock, and BCS mean field theories be mixed 1:1:1?”, when using the variational method, there is no stipulation on the number of undetermined coefficients, or rather, the variational extremum conditions for each undetermined coefficient are mutually independent. Therefore, the Density, Exchange, and Cooper Channels corresponding to Hartree, Fock, and BCS mean field theories in the decoupling method are in fact independent and do not double count. Thus, we have proven: Hartree, Fock, and BCS mean field theories can indeed be mixed 1:1:1.

However, the emergence of the Haldane Model and Chern Insulators allowed the Quantum Hall Effect to be realized in lattice systems without an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is called the “Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect”. In Chern Insulators, the non-trivial Berry Curvature distribution endows the lattice system with non-trivial topological properties similar to the Quantum Hall Effect, or even further, Berry Curvature replaces the magnetic field (although Berry Curvature is defined in reciprocal space, while the magnetic field appears in real space). Discussions on Chern Insulators and other topological phases derived from this have also become hot topics in the field of condensed matter theory in recent years. On the other hand, when the magnetic field strength is large enough that all electrons are degenerate in the Lowest Landau Level (LLL), especially when an electron occupies an integer (or fractional) number of quantum magnetic fluxes on average, the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect appears. Unlike the Quantum Hall Effect, Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect, or general topological insulators, the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect is the result of strong electron interactions degenerate in the LLL, whereas previous discussions were basically limited to non-interacting gapped Fermi systems. Fractional Quantum Hall systems possess topological ground state degeneracy (GSD), fractional excitations, and anyonic statistics, which may be applied to fields such as topological quantum computing. However, the condition requiring a magnetic field stronger than that for the Quantum Hall Effect can “dissuade” many who wish to apply this effect. Similar to various tenses in English grammar, we also want to combine “Anomalous” and “Fractional” to create a new Quantum Hall Effect, namely the “Fractional Anomalous Quantum Hall Effect” (FAQHE), abbreviated as “FAQ”. specifically, we hope this phenomenon can be realized in lattice systems. Combining the realization of the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Chern Insulators, physicists turned their attention to the topologically non-trivial Chern Band in Chern Insulators. Mimicking the fractionally filled LLL, they performed 1/3, 1/5, 1/7… electron fillings in the Chern Band and added electron-electron correlation terms (such as the Hubbard Model) to the system Hamiltonian to observe whether this fractionally filled Chern Insulator could exhibit phenomena similar to FQH systems (the previously mentioned GSD, fractional excitation, anyonic statistics, etc.). In numerical simulations of systems such as fractional filling, topologically non-trivial Haldane Model, and Kagome Lattice, phenomena such as a finite many-body gap in the thermodynamic limit, non-trivial GSD, and fractional excitations were indeed observed. Physicists named this novel topological state of matter “Fractional Chern Insulator” (FCI).

(i.e., restricting the Hilbert space considered to wave functions on the L.L.L.). Considering physics projected onto the L.L.L. is very important for analyzing neutral excitations (magneto-roton excitation) in FQH. This is introduced in detail in the article by GMP (Girvin, MacDonald, Platzman) in the 80s regarding magneto-roton excitation in FQH systems. However, GMP’s analysis only provided an ansatz variational wave function for low-energy excitations in FQH systems; variational methods can only give an upper bound on excitation energy.

The problem is, how to implement projection to L.L.L. The GMP paper tells us that for an operator in coordinate representation, we can make the following transformation: $$ \\begin{aligned} z_i^* \\rightarrow 2 \\ell^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_i} \\end{aligned} $$Naively, operators in coordinate representation should be functions of $z,\\,z^*$ (can always be Taylor Expanded), so we only need to know the result of projecting $z,\\,z^*$ onto L.L.L. The wave function in L.L.L. has the following form: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\psi(z)=f(z) e^{-\\frac{|z|^2}{4 \\ell^2}} \\end{aligned} $$After acting with $z$, since $zf(z)$ is still an analytic function, the wave function remains in L.L.L. after being acted upon by $z$, so no transformation is needed. $z^*$ is different, because $z^*f(z)$ will cause part of the wave function components to move to higher Landau Levels. Recalling the raising/lowering operators for Landau Levels: $$ \\begin{aligned} a^{\\dagger}=-i \\sqrt{2}\\left(l_B \\partial-\\frac{\\bar{z}}{4 l_B}\\right) \\end{aligned} $$This is equivalent to: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\bar{z}=4l_B^2 \\partial-i \\frac{4 l_Ba^{\\dagger}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{aligned} $$It can be seen that $z^*$ can be written as a Landau Level raising operator (mapping to higher Landau Level) and a $\\partial/\\partial z$ part. Since $\\partial f(z)/\\partial z$ is still an analytic function, only the $\\partial/\\partial z$ part should remain after projection. Note that the previous definition was used here: $$ \\begin{aligned} z=x-i y \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\bar{z}=x+i y \\end{aligned} $$$$ \\begin{aligned} \\partial=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\bar{\\partial}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}-i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\right) \\end{aligned} $$So there are some coefficient differences in the result compared to $z_i^* \\rightarrow 2 \\ell^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_i}$, but it is enough to understand why $z^*$ becomes $\\partial_z$ after projection to L.L.L. We have a more detailed derivation: Let the wave function on L.L.L. be completely represented by the analytic function in front of the exponential: $$ \\begin{aligned} |\\psi_f\\rangle \\equiv |f\\rangle \\end{aligned} $$Define its inner product (inner product weighted by an exponential factor): $$ \\begin{aligned} \\langle g|f\\rangle = \\int g\\left(z^*\\right) f(z) e^{-\\frac{|z|^2}{2 \\ell^2}} d x d y \\end{aligned} $$Thus the matrix element $\\langle g|z^*|f\\rangle$ of $z^*$ in the L.L.L. wave function space (Hilbert subspace) is: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\int g\\left(z^*\\right) z^* f(z) e^{-\\frac{|z|^2}{2 \\ell^2}} d x d y \\end{aligned} $$Write $z^*$ as obtained by operating $-2l^2 \\partial_z$ on the exponential factor: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\int g\\left(z^*\\right)\\left[ - 2 \\ell^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} e^{-\\frac{|z|^2}{2 \\ell^2}}\\right] f(z) d x d y \\end{aligned} $$Perform integration by parts, and using $\\partial_z g(z^*) = 0$, we have $$ \\begin{aligned} \\int g\\left(z^*\\right)\\left[2 \\ell^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} f(z)\\right] e^{-\\frac{|z|^2}{2 \\ell^2}} d x d y = \\langle g |2 \\ell^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}f\\rangle \\end{aligned} $$Note that here $2 \\ell^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ only acts on the analytic function $f(z)$ in front of the exponential. There is another problem. If there are both $z$ and $z^*$, they can be exchanged arbitrarily in the integral, but $2 \\ell^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}$ cannot be exchanged arbitrarily with $z$. Let’s consider the projection result of $zz^*$: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\int g\\left(z^*\\right) z z^* f(z) e^{-\\frac{-4}{2}} d x d y=\\int g\\left(z^*\\right)\\left[2 \\ell^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} z f(z)\\right] e^{-\\frac{-3 x}{2 z}} d x d y \\end{aligned} $$It is visible that during integration by parts, $\\partial_z$ will definitely include the analytic parts containing $z$ except for the exponential factor.

It plays a significant role in analyzing whether the FCI state appears and its stability in theory, numerics, and experiments. Of course, completely replicating the algebraic structure of FQH should be a necessary condition for the emergence of FCI, not completely equivalent to the condition for the emergence of the FCI state. Theories in this aspect await further research. Numerically, the Geometric Stability Hypothesis has been verified to some extent in various aspects such as ground state degeneracy and many-body gap.

This is an important factor for distinguishing FQH and FCI phases in numerics or experiments. Here we use the creation and annihilation of quasi-particle/quasi-hole pairs as a simple example to illustrate the non-degeneracy of the system ground state and its relationship with the topological properties of the background manifold. Consider an FQH system on a torus formed by identifying opposite edges of a square, i.e., an FQH system with periodic boundary conditions in both x and y directions. Now consider the creation and annihilation of quasi-particle/quasi-hole pairs. The quasi-particle/quasi-hole pair can go around the large circle of the torus (x-axis), created first and then annihilated; or around the small circle of the torus (y-axis), created first and then annihilated. Denote the system evolution operators of these two processes as $\\hat{T}_x$ and $\\hat{T}_y$. Since the torus has periodic boundary conditions in both x and y directions, we can prove that the process $\\hat{T}_x\\hat{T}_y\\hat{T}_x^{-1}\\hat{T}_y^{-1}$ on the torus is topologically equivalent to a quasi-particle going around a quasi-hole once. Due to the fractional statistics of quasi-particles or quasi-holes, the phase produced by this process is $e^{2 \\pi i/m}$, so we have: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{T}_x\\hat{T}_y = e^{2 \\pi i/m}\\hat{T}_y\\hat{T}_x \\end{aligned} $$Since the whole process starts from the ground state, creates quasi-particle/quasi-hole excitation on the ground state, and then annihilates, returning to the ground state (possibly different from the original ground state), $\\hat{T}_x$ and $\\hat{T}_y$ only have matrix elements between ground states. Whether degenerate or non-degenerate, $\\hat{T}_x$ and $\\hat{T}_y$ are matrices on the linear space based on the ground states $|0_1\\rangle,\\dots,|0_{GSD}\\rangle$. Solving for the matrices corresponding to $\\hat{T}_x$ and $\\hat{T}_y$ is actually finding the group representation of $\\hat{T}_x$ and $\\hat{T}_y$ in the ground state space. If the ground state $|0\\rangle$ is non-degenerate, since both $\\hat{T}_x$ and $\\hat{T}_y$ processes eventually return to the ground state, they produce at most a phase, $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{T}_x |0\\rangle = e^{i \\gamma_x} |0\\rangle \\end{aligned} $$$$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{T}_y |0\\rangle = e^{i \\gamma_y} |0\\rangle \\end{aligned} $$But this immediately leads to a contradiction, because there would be $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{T}_x \\hat{T}_y |0\\rangle = e^{i (\\gamma_x + \\gamma_y)} |0\\rangle = \\hat{T}_y \\hat{T}_x |0\\rangle \\end{aligned} $$In fact, starting from the relation $\\hat{T}_x\\hat{T}_y = e^{2 \\pi i/m}\\hat{T}_y\\hat{T}_x$ which tells us the non-Abelian nature of $\\hat{T}_x,\\,\\hat{T}_y$, we should realize that their group representation in the ground state space will certainly not be 1-dimensional, i.e., the ground state must not be non-degenerate (it must be degenerate)! Further analysis reveals that the group representation corresponding to the relation $\\hat{T}_x\\hat{T}_y = e^{2 \\pi i/m}\\hat{T}_y\\hat{T}_x$ is at least m-dimensional. In fact, for an FQH system with filling factor $\\nu = 1/m$ defined on $T^2$ space, the ground state degeneracy is: $$ \\begin{aligned} GSD = m \\end{aligned} $$The relationship with the topological properties of the FQH system’s background manifold is not hard to understand. Our derivation used: “The process $\\hat{T}_x\\hat{T}_y\\hat{T}_x^{-1}\\hat{T}_y^{-1}$ on the torus is topologically equivalent to a quasi-particle going around a quasi-hole once” For background manifolds with different genera, it is not difficult to imagine that more complex topological properties will lead to more exotic ground state degeneracy.

At the same time, we should have a large enough band gap so that wave functions between different Bands do not mix. This gives the first condition for the appearance of the FCI phase, the Flat Band condition: When the dispersion relation of the Chern Band approaches a flat band, the kinetic energy of the electron states on the Chern Band becomes smaller, and the influence of electron-electron interaction becomes stronger, making it more likely for exotic many-body strongly correlated states like FCI to appear. Twisted graphene, which has been hottest in recent years, is such a material. By adjusting parameters such as the relative twist angle $\\theta$ between two layers of graphene, the relative ratio $\\kappa$ of AA sublattice hopping and AB sublattice hopping strengths (which may be caused by phenomena like lattice relaxation), we can manipulate the dispersion relation near the Fermi surface to make it tend to be flat. Near the magic angle $\\theta_c \\approx 1.05^\\circ$ and chiral limit $\\kappa =0$, an almost strictly flat band can be obtained, and the band has topological properties (non-zero Chern number), becoming an important platform for studying the FCI phase. Later we will also introduce the role of other lattice system properties besides dispersion relation on the appearance of the FCI phase, such as the distribution of Berry Curvature of the Chern Band in the Brillouin Zone (BZ), and the influence of Geometry factors such as Fubini-Study Metric of the Chern Band on the FCI phase. Naively, requiring both special dispersion relation and special band geometry seems to make the condition for FCI appearance very harsh. But in fact, the dispersion relation and wave function of a lattice Hamiltonian (Berry Curvature, Fubini-Study Metric and other Band Geometry factors are actually related to the wave function) are somewhat independent. For a band with dispersion relation $\\epsilon(k)$, we can always transform it into a 2-flat band dispersion relation while keeping the mapping from BZ to wave function space and its derived Berry Curvature and Band Geometry unchanged. $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{H} = \\sum_k \\epsilon(k) |u_k\\rangle \\langle u_k| \\rightarrow \\hat{H}_{flat} = \\sum_k \\epsilon_0 |u_k\\rangle \\langle u_k| \\end{aligned} $$The two are topologically equivalent as long as the gap between bands does not close during the transformation.

Combined with the form of the many-body wave function given by Laughlin, we can reasonably guess the properties of the FCI state many-body wave function in the Chern Band. Simply put, the single-particle wave function calculated by Landau gauge is an extended plane wave in the y-direction and a localized harmonic oscillator wave function in the x-direction; In the Chern Band, due to the non-trivial band topology, this corresponds to topologically protected edge states. Therefore, general Fourier Transformation cannot obtain a Wannier Wavefunction localized in both x and y directions. However, one can perform Partial Fourier Transformation only in the x-direction to obtain a partial Wannier Function localized in the x-direction and extended in the y-direction. Comparing these two single-particle wave functions, it is not difficult to relate them.
