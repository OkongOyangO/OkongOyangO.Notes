    <title>What did Fermi Golden Rule Miss?</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This article aims to calculate the strict quantum transition rate and points out that the Fermi Golden Rule is the result of its &ldquo;long-time average&rdquo;. The strict quantum transition rate contains an additional double-frequency oscillation term with non-negligible amplitude compared to the Fermi Golden Rule. The relationship between the two is similar to &ldquo;instantaneous power&rdquo; and &ldquo;average power&rdquo; in AC circuits.</p>
<h2 id="fermi-golden-rule">Fermi Golden Rule</h2>
<p>The Fermi Golden Rule aims to calculate the transition rate of a quantum system from an initial state $|i\rangle$ to a final state $|f\rangle$ (both are eigenstates of $H_0$) under a time-harmonic external field perturbation. Since this is well-covered in quantum mechanics courses, we will quickly go through it in the Dirac picture (interaction picture). The Dirac picture is used to better compare with the Kubo Formula.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Mean Field Approximation and Variational Method | Can Hartree, Fock, and BCS be Mixed 1:1:1?</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This article aims to introduce the mean field approximation while elucidating its variational nature.</p>
<p>Hartree, Fock, and BCS—these individual mean field approximations appear to be mutually incompatible decoupling methods. However, by leveraging the variational nature of the mean field approximation, we discover that they can indeed be mixed 1:1:1.</p>
<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>The inspiration for this article primarily comes from discussions with classmate <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/li-yong-kang-9-34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">@ykli</a>. I would like to express my special thanks to <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/li-yong-kang-9-34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">@ykli</a> for the significant assistance provided during the derivation process.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Fermi Golden Rule? Just Joule Heat!</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This article aims to clarify the consistency between Fermi&rsquo;s Golden Rule and Joule Heat.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Fermi&rsquo;s Golden Rule can calculate the system&rsquo;s absorption of electromagnetic fields, while the Kubo Formula can calculate the current response, and the Joule heat formula can also calculate the absorption of electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p>The former seems to calculate entirely from the perspective of quantum transitions, while the latter seems to calculate entirely from the perspective of Joule heat. However, both are essentially applications of time-dependent perturbation theory in quantum mechanics. We touched upon this in the previous two articles, but did not elaborate on their consistency.

    <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE), Fractional Anomalous Quantum Hall Effect (FAQHE) and Fractional Chern Insulator (FCI)</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This note is approximately 10,000 words long and aims to help readers get started with Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE), Fractional Anomalous Quantum Hall Effect (FAQHE), and Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI). This article represents only my personal perspective and may contain errors; I welcome corrections from readers. Below is the main text.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-fqhe-faqhe--fci">Introduction to FQHE, FAQHE &amp; FCI</h2>
<p>The Quantum Hall Effect requires a strong magnetic field environment to be realized. However, the emergence of the Haldane Model and Chern Insulators allowed the Quantum Hall Effect to be realized in <strong>lattice systems without an external magnetic field</strong>. This phenomenon is called the &ldquo;Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect&rdquo;. In Chern Insulators, the non-trivial Berry Curvature distribution endows the lattice system with non-trivial topological properties similar to the Quantum Hall Effect, or even further, <strong>Berry Curvature replaces the magnetic field</strong> (although Berry Curvature is defined in reciprocal space, while the magnetic field appears in real space). Discussions on Chern Insulators and other topological phases derived from this have also become hot topics in the field of condensed matter theory in recent years.</p>]]></description>

    <title>How to Distinguish Conductors and Insulators by Ground State Only? 🤔</title>
    <link>https://OkongOyangO.github.io/OkongOyangO.Notes/posts/distinguish_conductors_insulators_ground_state/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>This note aims to elucidate the connection between the <strong>conductivity</strong> of a many-body system and the <strong>quantum geometry of its ground state</strong>, and to explain how to distinguish between conductors and insulators solely based on the &ldquo;locality&rdquo; of the ground state wavefunction.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Distinguishing conductors and insulators by only looking at the ground state&rdquo;—this argument seems a bit outrageous.</p>
<p>The Band Theory of the 1930s (to some extent) explained the difference between conductors and insulators. At the non-interacting level, conductors and insulators can be distinguished by whether the ground state energy bands are filled. If the valence band is filled and there is a band gap $E_g &gt; 0$ separating it from the conduction band, it is an insulator; otherwise, it is a conductor. Here, the band gap $E_g$ is used to distinguish them, but defining $E_g$ requires knowing the energy of excited states, thus inevitably involving excited state properties.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Nonlinear Response Theory of the Kubo Formula</title>

<h1 id="nonlinear-response-theory-of-the-kubo-formula">Nonlinear Response Theory of the Kubo Formula</h1>
<p>This article aims to derive the nonlinear response theory of the Kubo Formula.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Both linear and nonlinear response theories of the Kubo Formula are essentially perturbation theories in quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Linear response is more common; for example, experimentally measured susceptibilities such as conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, and electric polarizability are all linear response functions (Retarded Green Functions).</p>
<p>However, nonlinear response also has its application values, such as second-order current response in semiconductors, including Second Harmonic Generation, Injection and Shift Current, etc.</p>]]></description>
